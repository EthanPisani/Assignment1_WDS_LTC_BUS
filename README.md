# Assignemnt 1

## Lab 1

This lab (`Lab_1.ipynb`) introduces students to essential Python libraries for data science: Pandas, Numpy, and Statsmodels. You will learn to manipulate and analyze tabular data using Pandas, perform numerical operations and linear algebra with Numpy, and conduct simple linear regression analysis with Statsmodels. The exercises provide hands-on experience in data exploration, computation, and modeling. By the end of the lab, you will have a foundational understanding of these tools and their applications in data analysis.

## Assignment 1

In this assignment (`Assignment_1.ipynb`), you're going to write your own methods to fit a linear model using either an OLS or LAD cost function.  
This assignment will use data representing possums in Australia and New Guinea in the file `possum.csv`.
